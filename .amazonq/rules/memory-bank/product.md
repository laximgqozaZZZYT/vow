# VOW - Habit and Goal Management System

## Project Purpose
VOW is a web-based habit and goal management system designed to help users track and manage their daily "things to do" and "things not to do". The system provides visualization of habit continuity and goal completion to support behavioral improvement through data-driven insights.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Goal Management
- Hierarchical goal structure with parent-child relationships
- Goal completion tracking with cascade updates to child goals and habits
- Tree-based organization for complex goal hierarchies
- Automatic "Inbox" goal creation for unassigned habits

### Habit Tracking
- Comprehensive habit creation and management
- Activity logging (start, pause, complete, skip operations)
- Persistent activity history that survives page reloads
- Flexible scheduling with JSON-based timing configurations
- Support for reminders, outdates, and custom timing patterns

### Dashboard and Analytics
- Customizable dashboard with configurable section layouts
- Real-time activity tracking and statistics
- Visual progress indicators and completion metrics
- Diary-style activity logging interface

### User Preferences and Customization
- Flexible preference system with arbitrary key-value storage
- Layout customization for dashboard sections
- Persistent UI state management across sessions

## Target Users and Use Cases

### Primary Users
- **Individual Users**: People seeking to establish and maintain positive habits while eliminating negative ones
- **Habit Improvement Seekers**: Users who want data-driven insights into their behavioral patterns
- **Goal-Oriented Individuals**: People managing complex, hierarchical objectives

### Key Use Cases
- **Daily Habit Tracking**: Log completion of recurring activities like exercise, meditation, or reading
- **Goal Achievement**: Break down large objectives into manageable habits and track progress
- **Behavioral Analysis**: Review historical data to identify patterns and improvement opportunities
- **Habit Formation**: Use structured tracking to establish new positive behaviors
- **Habit Breaking**: Monitor and reduce unwanted behaviors through awareness and tracking

## Value Proposition
VOW transforms abstract behavioral goals into concrete, trackable actions with persistent data storage, flexible organization, and intuitive visualization. The system bridges the gap between intention and execution by providing structure, accountability, and insights that support sustainable behavioral change.
